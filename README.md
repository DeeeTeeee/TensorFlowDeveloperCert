## Learning towards my TensorFlow Developer Certification Exam
I'm excited to embark on the journey of becoming a TensorFlow Developer and earning the Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate. TensorFlow is an amazing open-source deep learning framework that is highly sought after in the industry. With the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, I'll be equipped with the skills to build and train powerful machine learning models using TensorFlow.

So, I upload my learning progress here on this repo

Throughout this hands-on, four-course program, I'll gain the necessary tools and knowledge to create AI-powered applications that scale. The practical experience I'll gain will enable me to apply TensorFlow to a wide range of real-world projects and problems. This program is not only a fantastic learning opportunity but also a stepping stone towards achieving the Google TensorFlow Certificate.

Completing this comprehensive program, I'll not only become proficient in TensorFlow but also be well-prepared for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam. I dived into the material and unlock the potential of deep learning with TensorFlow. 
## This is my chance to make a mark in the world of machine learning and take my skills to the next level.
